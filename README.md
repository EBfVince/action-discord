## Usage

### New YML synthax

```yaml
- name: Discord notification
  env:
    DISCORD_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK }}
  uses: Ilshidur/action-discord@master
  with:
    args: 'The project has been deployed.'
```

### (legacy) HCL synthax

```
action "Discord notification" {
  uses = "Ilshidur/action-discord@master"
  secrets = ["DISCORD_WEBHOOK"]
  args = "The project has been deployed."
}
```

**NOTICE :** for stability purposes, it is recommended to use the action with an explicit commit SHA-1 :

`uses = "Ilshidur/actions/discord@a08c189"` (=> link to the commits list : https://github.com/Ilshidur/actions/commits/master)

### Arguments

By default, the GitHub action will send a notificaction with the event informations. Providing the arguments will override the message.

#### Examples

* `args = "Hello, beautiful ! I ran a GitHub Actions for you <3"`
* `args = "I showed you my commit. Please respond."`

### Secrets

* **`DISCORD_WEBHOOK`** (**required**): the Discord webhook URL (see https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
  * ***IMPORTANT !!* You MUST NOT append `/github` at the end of the webhook.**
* That's all.
