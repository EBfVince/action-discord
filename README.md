```
action "Discord notification" {
  uses = "Ilshidur/actions/discord@master"
  secrets = ["DISCORD_WEBHOOK"]

### Secrets

* **`DISCORD_WEBHOOK`** (**required**): the Discord webhook URL (see https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
  * ***IMPORTANT !!* You MUST NOT append `/github` at the end of the webhook.**
* That's all.
